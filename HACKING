Guide for potential hackers on Lightweight Autonomic Network Architecture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a public Git repository where you can check out the latest
Lightweight Autonomic Network Architecture sources:

$ git clone git://repo.or.cz/ana-net.git

For hacking the source you definately need a bleeding-edge kernel since LANA
is currently developed against the latest linus Git tree. Check	it out via

$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git

and read the INSTALL file for compiling and running the kernel, but you
probably already know how to do this. ;-)

Also, using a serial console for testing and debugging purpose is quite
useful, especially when you get a panic or Ooops within interrupt context!
Assuming you are using GRUB2 (there's really no magic for other versions),
simply add 'console=/dev/ttyS0,9600n8' to the kernel cmdline parameters,
e.g.:

menuentry 'Debian/Linux 2.6.38-rc8+' --class debian --class gnu-linux
				     --class gnu --class os {
  insmod part_msdos
  insmod ext2
  set root='(hd0,msdos6)'
  search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set <bla>
  linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-rc8+ root=UUID=<bla> ro console=/dev/ttyS0,9600n8
  initrd  /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-rc8+
}

If you also want to redirect tty output of your devel os to the serial port,
add to the /etc/inittab in the development system:

co:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty ttyS0 9600 vt100-nav

Then reboot that machine. If you're using this kernel within qemu, the map
the serial device to your host os with qemu <...> -serial /dev/ttyX <...>
(where X is a number for instance) or map it to a file as qemu 
<...> -serial file:serial.log <...>. For ttys you can use minicom to connect
and see relevant stack traces if your kernel crashes within interrupt mode
for instance. This gives you at least a stack trace via serial console, so
that you are at least able to see the whole stack printout.

You can obtain minicom on Debian via: # apt-get install minicom
minicom's configuration on your local machine should look like this:

  Serial Device         : /dev/ttyXY
  Lockfile Location     : /var/lock
  Callin Program        :
  Callout Program       :
  Bps/Par/Bits          : 9600 8N1
  Hardware Flow Control : No
  Software Flow Control : No

For vim hackers there's also a tiny plugin in tools/vim80warn.vim that
warns you if more than 80 chars have been used on a single line. Install
it by creating a directory ~/.vim/plugin directory and copy this plugin
into this directory, restart vim and you're good to go.

Note that there are also some file naming conventions! fb_*.c|h is a
functional block. Ideally you place all the neccessary code that is related
to the fb into this file, so that the src directory stays clean.
All the other non-fb_* files are regarded as LANA core files, which are
mandatory for the network stack to operate.

Function naming conventions for functional blocks are similar. Always have
a prefix of 'fb_', even for static functions. All the rest follows Linux
kernel coding conventions as described in CODING. You can use the kernels
check_patch.pl script for style errors, trailing whitespaces and so on
before submitting a patch.

There's a sem/ folder with Coccinelle scripts that performs semantic
patching on the lana kernelspace code. If you are using Debian, install
Coccinelle with ...

  # apt-get install coccinelle

... and run make within sem/. Possible patches are saved within this folder
after the run. For hacking own Coccinelle scripts, have a look at their
website for documentation http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/ and for usage examples
http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/rules/.

Please send your ideas or patches for LANA mainline inclusion to:
ariane.keller@tik.ee.ethz.ch, wolfgang.muehlbauer@tik.ee.ethz.ch or 
dborkma@tik.ee.ethz.ch

There's a public website about the Autonomic Network Architecture project
with previous prototypes and further documentation:

LANA is developed at the Communication Systems Group of the Swiss federal
institute of technology (ETH Zurich).
