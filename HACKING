Guide for potential hackers on Lightweight Autonomic Network Architecture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Git repository:
	git clone git://repo.or.cz/ana-net.git

File naming conventions:
	fb_*: is a functional block, ideally you place all the neccessary
	      code that is related to the fb into this file
        else: all other file are regarded as ANA core files, which are
	      mandatory for the network stack to operate

For vim hackers:
	tools/vim80warn.vim is a tiny plugin that warns you if more than
	80 chars have been used on a single line. Install it with by 
	creating a directory ~/.vim/plugin directory and copy this plugin
	into this directory, restart vim and you're good to go.

Please send your ideas or patches for ANA mainline inclusion to:
	ariane.keller@tik.ee.ethz.ch   and
	dborkma@tik.ee.ethz.ch
