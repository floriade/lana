  abstract = {The recursive network architecture (RNA) explores the relationship of
       layering to protocol and network architecture. RNA examines the
       implications of using a single, tunable protocol, called a
       metaprotocol, for different layers of the protocol stack,
       reusing basic protocol operations across different protocol
       layers to avoid reimplementation. Its primary goal is to
       encourage cleaner cross-layer interaction, to support dynamic
       service composition, and to gain an understanding of how
       layering affects architecture. This paper provides a
       description of RNA and a recently completed initial prototype.
       The prototype extends the Click modular router with control
       capabilities including dynamic composition and discovery. These
       capabilities are used to demonstrate simple but flexible stacks
       of instances of a metaprotocol that are customizable at
       runtime.},

       feature to adapt the network structure to the location, number
       and size of currently configured hardware modules. The network
       consists of the minimal number of switches required. Switches
       can be added or removed from the network by a global control
       instance at runtime. Compared to common fixed network-on-chip
       structures, the CoNoChi architecture reduces the area
       requirements and latency of the network and eases the online
       placement of hardware modules. Two variants of CoNoChi are
       presented: one is based on a homogeneous hardware structure
       that is dynamically reconfigurable on logic block level, and
       the other one is adapted to the limited partial reconfiguration
       capabilities of Xilinx Virtex-II (Pro) FPGAs},

       serve as basic building blocks for the protocol configuration.
       Common software engineering principles like encapsulation and

       the unconstrained configuration of modules to protocols. The Da

	Abstract = {A modern SoC design comprises dozens of dedicated IP cores for specialized tasks and processors for general-purpose tasks. Flexibility is the key feature of processors, since it is easy to modify their tasks behavior at runtime. However, most current SoCs have no capability to modify the hardware behavior or structure after system fabrication. On the other hand, to cope with current SoC internal communication complexity, suggestions to employ networks-on-chip (NoCs) are becoming widespread. This paper proposes to extend the inherent software flexibility to hard IP cores in SoCs using NoCs as the main internal communication resource. This is achieved by making IP cores reconfigurable. The paper advances two main contributions: first, a straightforward design flow for SoCs with reconfigurable IP cores; second, the proposition of a NoC, named Artemis, supporting IP core reconfiguration},

Common placement algorithms, e.g. Best Fit, are designed for homogeneous architectures, since they do not consider any placement constraints of the hardware tasks. Due to the integration of, e.g., dedicated memory, current FPGAs are heterogeneous reconfigurable architectures. In this paper we introduce two heterogeneous placement algorithms, which are able to deal with the constraints of the hardware tasks. Both algorithms are compared to the Best Fit algorithm by using a simulation framework for partially configurable architectures. We propose concepts of an efficient hardware realization of our placement approach with Xilinx Virtex-II FPGAs. Moreover, we present a task placement mechanism to change the position of a hardware task on the FPGA by manipulating the configuration data of the task},

New capabilities such as on-demand computing power, self-adaptiveness and self-optimization capabilities by restructuring the hardware on the fly at run-time is seen as a driving technology factor for current research initiatives such as autonomic (Kephart and Chess,Computer,36:4152, 2003; IBM Autonomic Computing Initiative, (http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/)) and organic computing (M{\~{A}}{$\frac{1}{4}$}ller-Schloer, von der Malsburg, and W{\~{A}}{$\frac{1}{4}$}rtz,Inform.-Spektrum,27:332336, 2004; The Organic Computing Page, (http://www.organic-computing.org)). Much research work is currently devoted to models for partial hardware module relocation (SPP1148 Reconfigurable Computing Priority Program, (http://www12.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/spprr/)) and dynamically reconfigurable hardware reconfiguration on e.g., FPGA-based platforms. However, there are many physical restrictions and technical problems limiting the scope or applicability of these approaches. This led us to the development of a new FPGA-based reconfigurable computer called theErlangen Slot Machine. The architecture overcomes many architectural constraints of existing platforms and allows a user to partially reconfigure hardware modules arranged in so-calledslots. The uniqueness of this computer stems from (a) a new slot-oriented hardware architecture, (b) a set of novel inter-module communication paradigms, and (c) concepts for dynamic and partial reconfiguration management.},

	Abstract = {Swappable Logic Units (SLUs) were introduced by the author previously (1996) to play a role in virtual hardware subsystems that is analogous to the role of pages or segments in virtual memory subsystems. The intention is that a conventional operating system can be extended to manage SLU circuitry implemented using FPGA real estate. In order to minimise operating system overheads, two particular SLU-based virtual hardware models were deemed practical: a {``}sea of accelerators{''} model and a {``}parallel harness{''} model. This paper looks in some detail at how SLUs will fit within the overall environment of a fairly conventional hardware/software system. First, there is a discussion of the FPGA-based hardware environment for SLUs, followed by a discussion of the software environment from which SLUs might be used. After this, there is a description of the operational properties that SLUs can have, and how these fit in with the two virtual hardware models. Finally, proposals for standard interfaces between SLUs and their environment are discussed. These interfaces can be regarded as constraints on the designers of SLU circuitry or, more positively, as suppliers of an enriched context within which such circuitry operates. The overall impact of the work presented in the paper is to show that it is feasible to incorporate configurable hardware within traditional computer systems that use high- level language programs and computer operating systems. That is, it should not always be necessary to devise special-purpose hardware/software systems to realise custom computing},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of executing a dynamically changing set of tasks on a reconfigurable system, made upon a processor and a reconfigurable device. Task execution on such a platform is managed by a scheduler that can allocate tasks either to the processor or to the reconfigurable device. The scheduler can be seen as part of an operating system running on the software or as core in the reconfigurable device. For each tasks to be executed on reconfigurable device, an equivalent implementation exists as rectangular block in a database. This block has to be placed on the device at run-time. A placer is responsible for the placement of tasks received from the scheduler on the reconfigurable device. However, the placement of tasks on the reconfigurable device cannot be successful if enough space is not available on the device to hold the task. In this case, the scheduler receive an acknowledgment from the placer and decide either to preempt a running task or to run the task on software. We present in this work an implementation of a placer module as well as investigations on task preemption. The two modules are part of an operating system for reconfigurable system currently under development.},

The central idea behind FlexPath NP is to systematically map network processor (NP) application sub-functions onto both SW programmable processor (CPU) resources and (re-)configurable HW building blocks, such that different packet flows are forwarded via different, optimized processing paths through the NP. Packets with well understood, relatively simple processing requirements may even bypass the central CPU complex (AutoRoute). In consequence, CPU processing resources are more effectively used and the overall NP performance and throughput are improved compared to conventional NP architectures. We present analytical performance estimations to quantify the performance advantage of FlexPath (expressed as available CPU instructions for each packet traversing the CPUs) and introduce a platform-based System on Programmable Chip (SoPC) based architecture which implements the FlexPath NP concept.},

The network processor incorporates a processor and a number of coprocessors that can be connected to the processor either directly or using a shared bus. The analysis investigates the configuration (in terms of co-processor distributions and interface), formulates the throughput that meets the network demands and the constraints of the platform (area, bus bandwidth, etc.) and takes into account the reconfiguration overhead. To find the configuration that meets the constraints, the platform is formulated into integer linear programming equations. Furthermore, the results of two case studies are presented, for a soft- and a hard-IP core processor, that uses three flows with different processing requirements (IP forward, encryption and media processing). In each case the number and the type of co-processors is shown in terms of the network distribution and the average packet size. Finally, the mapping of the framework in the Xilinx FPGA platform is discussed},

The platform consists of two MicroBlaze RISC processors and a number of hardware co-processors used for the processing of the packet{'}s payload (DES encryption and Lempel- Ziv Compression). The co-processors can be connected either directly to the processors or using a shared bus. The type of the co-processors is dynamically reconfigured to meet the requirements of the network workload. The system has been implemented in the Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA platform and the network traces from real passive measurements have been used for performance evaluation. The use of dynamically reconfigurable co-processors for network applications shows that the performance speedup versus a static version varies from 12% to 35% in the best case and from 10% to 15% on average, depending on the variability in time and distribution of the network traffic.},

Designing Network Intrusion Detection systems (NIDS) calls for high performance circuits in order to keep up with the rising data rates. Offloading software processing to hardware realizations is not an economically viable solution and hence hardware-software based hybrid solutions for the NIDS scenario are discussed in literature. By deploying processing on both hardware and software cores simultaneously by using a novel Intelligent Rule Parsing algorithm, we aim to minimize the number of packets whose waiting time is greater than a predefined threshold. This fairness criterion implicitly ensures in obtaining a higher throughput as depicted by our results.},

       all levels of the architecture. IDPs completely decouple
       functional entities by means of indirection thus enabling
       evolving protocol stacks. Our architecture also provides a
       consistent application programming interface (API) to access
       node-local or network-wide functionality. In addition to the

       prototype of the architecture and we give examples of its
