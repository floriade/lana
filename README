Abstract: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2065222

Network programming is widely understood as programming strictly defined socket
interfaces. Only some frameworks have made a step towards 'real' network
programming by decomposing networking functionality into small modular blocks
(functional blocks) that can be assembled in a flexible, graph-like manner. In
this work, we tackle the challenge of accommodating 3 partially conflicting
objectives:

   (i) high flexibility for network programmers,
  (ii) re-configuration of the network stack at runtime, and 
 (iii) high packet forwarding rates.

First experiences with a prototype implementation in Linux suggest little
performance overhead compared to the standard Linux protocol stack.

How to browse the source:
   src/             - Contains all kernel modules of LANA
   usr/             - Contains userspace configuration tools for LANA
   app/             - Contains a voice-over-Ethernet application that
                      uses PF_LANA BSD sockets
   sem/             - Contains a set of semantic patches that can be
                      used with Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)
   opt/             - Contains misc stuff, not really important
   doc/             - The name says everything, you need LaTeX for this

Within the src/ folder, there are files named:
   fb_*.c           - These are functional block kernel modules
   core.c           - LANA core loader (-> lana.ko)
   xt_*.{c,h}       - LANA core extensions

For questions, bugs and other things, you can write the authors, see the
REPORTING-BUGS file. Happy Kernel Hacking! :-)
